# apg_flask
Flask wrapper around the [audio program generator](https://github.com/jeffwright13/audio_program_generator) module

# Current status
beta+ ... meaning, it runs out of the box:
  - locally on my Macbook Pro w/ Catalina 10.15.7,
    with ffmpeg version 4.4 installed via homebrew;
  - on Heroku, with ffmpeg buildpack installed
    (https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks/jonathanong/heroku-buildpack-ffmpeg-latest)
This code also runs on AWS Lambda but requires mods (see branch
"heroku" (2a4684c).
